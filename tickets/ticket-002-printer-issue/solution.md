Troubleshooting Steps and Solution

1: Opened "Printers and Scanners" and verified the printer (Microsoft Print to PDF) was installed correctly and set as the default printer

2: Attempted to print a document and noticed that the job remained stuck inside of the print queue

3: Opened up the print queue to see potential issues and noticed that the job was paused, which caused the job to be blocked from completing the print process

4: Opened up the print queue manager, right clicked the paused job and resumed the print job

5: Cleared older completed jobs from the queue and successfully reprinted the document.
