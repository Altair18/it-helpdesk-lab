Troubleshooting Steps and Solution

1: Confirmed user was connected to the network and had no general performance issues.

2: Checked Task Manager and found multiple Outlook processes already running in the background.

3: Ended all Outlook processes/tasks to clear the state

4: Held "Win + R" and ran "outlook.exe /safe" in order to attempt to run it in safe mode launch

5: Outlook launched and confirmed that the backgroud processes were likely causing the issue

6: Restarted Outlook normally and it opened without issues
